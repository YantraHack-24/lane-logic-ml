        We propose the implementation of a lane priority algorithm to assist traffic junction congestions in urban areas. The deep learning algorithm and API calls operate on parallel threads, while the priority algorithm runs multiple times within each cycle. The cycle time is defined as the total time taken for each lane to receive the green light at least once. Once every lane has received a green light in the current cycle, the cycle is reset, and the priority mask is updated. The priority mask consists of four floating-point values ranging from 0 to 1.

             In a traffic management context, the count represents the *frequency or number of vehicles* detected on each road during a specific period of time. This information can be valuable for understanding the distribution of traffic across different roads and intersections within a city or urban area.
             For instance, **if Road 1 has a higher count compared to other roads, it suggests that more vehicles are using Road 1 during the analyzed period. This could indicate that Road 1 is a major thoroughfare or that there may be congestion or other traffic-related issues that need attention**.
             Analyzing and visualizing the count of vehicles on each road can help traffic engineers, urban planners, and policymakers make informed decisions about traffic flow management, infrastructure improvements, traffic signal timings, and other measures aimed at optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion.
